# 🚇 Pune Metro Passenger Dashboard (2022–2024)

This project is an interactive data visualization built using **Tableau Public** to analyze **Pune Metro passenger data** between 2022 and 2024 across the Aqua and Purple lines.

---

## 📊 Overview

The dashboard provides insights into:
- Passenger travel patterns between stations
- Fare distribution (up to ₹30 based on distance)
- Peak travel times and monthly ridership trends
- Station usage and interchange traffic (e.g., District Court)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Tableau Public** – for creating visual dashboards  
- **Microsoft Excel** – for data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **CSV/Excel files** – for storing customer and station data  
- **Geo-mapping** – using Latitude and Longitude for visualizing station locations on the map

---

## 📂 Dataset Details

The dataset contains:
- `Customer_ID`
- `Start_Station`
- `End_Station`
- `Date` (from 2022 to 2024)
- `Ticket_Price` (based on distance, max ₹30)
- `Line_Name` (Aqua / Purple)
- `Latitude` & `Longitude` of stations

> Note: The station "District Court" is included in both Aqua and Purple lines as an **interchange station**.
